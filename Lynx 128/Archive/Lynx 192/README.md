# Camputers Lynx 192K

Camputers Lynx 128K Mark 2 Issue A without the RAM jumpers preset. It can be populated with 3 sets of 4164 RAM.

We've tested this board, but not to 192K capacity. We think it might need a different ROM. This does not set the RAM configuration jumpers as the manufacturered 128K board did. This still needs the single bodge wire running. Other factory bodges were to fix factory defects that aren't present on this board.
