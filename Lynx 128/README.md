# Camputers Lynx 128K

 Camputers Lynx 128K Mark 2 Issue A

![Built 192K board in green](https://github.com/Board-Folk/Camputers-Lynx/blob/main/images/Lynx128192.png)

The version in this folder hasn't been made. We don't see why this shouldn't work. We have tested the board in the Archive/Lynx 192 folder though, but not working to 192K capacity, see any notes in there. That version does not have the RAM configuration jumpers preset which we perceive might be beneficial to some. This still needs the single bodge wire running, will try to dig out the exact details, it's been a while. Other factory bodges (to the bottom) were to fix factory defects that aren't present on this board.

This is a horrible merry-go-round of a board to debug and not for the feint hearted.
